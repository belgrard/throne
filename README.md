## 👑 What is Throne?

**Throne** is a next-generation emulator for Habbo retro environments, written entirely in **Rust** for extreme speed, safety and scalability.

Throne is not just another emulator — it’s a **revolution** in how retro hotels run.

## ⚡ Why Throne?

Let’s break it down:

- 🦀 **Rust-Powered Core**  
  Thread-safe. Memory-safe. Zero-cost abstractions. Performance that outclasses traditional emulators written in PHP, C#, or Java.

- 🔄 **Non-blocking, Asynchronous Networking**  
  Powered by **Tokio**, built for scale. Whether you're hosting 10 or 10,000 users — Throne is ready.

- 🧠 **Modular Packet System**  
  Packet definitions are clean, type-safe, and easy to extend. Say goodbye to spaghetti code.

- 🔐 **JWT Authentication Ready**  
  Works out-of-the-box with Crown CMS. Secure login flows with modern standards — no legacy tokens, no old hacks.
